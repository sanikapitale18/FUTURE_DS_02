📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Future Interns Internship
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains Task 2 completed as part of the Future Interns Internship Program.
The objective of this task was to perform Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

EDA is a crucial step in the data science workflow, as it helps in understanding the structure, quality, and relationships within the data before applying machine learning models.

🎯 Objectives

Load and understand the dataset structure

Clean and preprocess raw data

Handle missing values and inconsistencies

Perform descriptive & statistical analysis

Identify trends, correlations, and patterns

Create visualizations for better insight communication
